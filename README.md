# Print Numbers 1 to N Without Loops

This repository contains a simple Python solution to print numbers from 1 to N **without using loops**. Instead of traditional `for` or `while` loops, the approach uses **recursion** to demonstrate how repetitive tasks can be handled with elegant, stack-based function calls.

## ðŸš€ How It Works

The function repeatedly calls itself with decreasing values until it reaches the base case (`n == 1`). Once it hits the base case, it begins printing numbers as the call stack unwinds.
